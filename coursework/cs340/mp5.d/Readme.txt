Notes:
	Cards in a hand are ordered by suit: Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades.
	Random number generator is seeded so each shuffle is different.
	Quit command asks for confirmation: "Are you sure you want to quit?"
	Number of cards in deck is shown as: zero, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, many
	Full-page help, with rules, and "[press a key to return to the game]"

	Fix messages like "Draw pile has 1 cards."
	Add documentation to file headers.
	Remove unnecessary includes, declarations, functions;
	Move some hard-coded numbers to constants
