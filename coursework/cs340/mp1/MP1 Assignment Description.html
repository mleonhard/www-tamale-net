</p>
For this project, you are to write two programs that will
perform <a href="http://www.profactor.at/~wstoec/rsa.html">
Public-Key Encryption using the RSA Algorithm</a>.  The first
program will create the public-key private-key pair.  The
second program will use a key to encrypt/decrypt an ASCII
text message.
<p>
The RSA alogorithm needs three related numbers to work.  These
number will be called e, d and n.  The pair (e,n) compose the
public-key, while the pair (d,n) compose the private key.  
To encrypt a value m into m' we preform the operation of:
<pre>
     m' = m<sup>e</sup> mod n
</pre>
To decrypt the value of m' back to m, we perform the operation of:
<pre>
     m  = m'<sup>d</sup> mod n
</pre>
Note that the value of m must be less than n in order for this to work.
Since we are encrypting/decrypting ASCII text messages and the largest
ASCII value is 127, the value of n must be at least 128.
<p>
The creation of the values of e, d and n start with the selection
of two prime numbers p and q.  The value of n is the result of p * q.
Thus we need to make sure that the values p and q are large enough
so that the resulting value of n is larger than any value we wish
to encrypt.
<pre>
     n  = p * q
</pre>
<p>
To create e and d, we first must create a value &phi; which is:
<pre>
     &phi;  = (p-1) * (q-1)
</pre>
The value of e some arbitrary number that is less than n and relatively
prime to &phi;.  There should be many numbers that fit this criteria
and any one is valid.  A number x is relatively prime of y if they have
no divisor in common other than 1.  This means the GCD (Greatest Common 
Divisor) is 1.  The GCD of two numbers can be computed via the 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm">
Euclidean Algorithm</a>.
<p>
The value of d can be calculated once e has been determined. The value
of d is the inverse of e modulo &phi;.  Which means
<pre>
     (e * d) mod &phi; = 1
</pre>
The calculation of both e and d is done via trial and error.  You start
with a possible value and see if it is valid.  If not, you change the
value and try again.  This is done in a loop which exits when a valid
value is found.  The code for calculation of e, d and n from the values
of p and q can be found at

<p>
<h3>Key Creation Program</h3>
The keys that are to be created by the first program and
used by the second program are to be stored in files using
the XML format.  Note that the names of tags must match what
is given below, but the spacing need not.  Also, the order of
the e and n values in the public key and the order of the d and
n values in the private key can be reversed.
<p>
The public key is to be store as:
<pre>
     &lt;rsakey&gt;
        &lt;evalue&gt;value-of-e&lt;/evalue&gt;
        &lt;nvalue&gt;value-of-n&lt;/nvalue&gt;
     &lt;/rsakey&gt;
</pre>
The private key is to be stored as:
<pre>
     &lt;rsakey&gt;
        &lt;dvalue&gt;value-of-d&lt;/dvalue&gt;
        &lt;nvalue&gt;value-of-n&lt;/nvalue&gt;
     &lt;/rsakey&gt;
</pre>

<p>
The program that creates the keys will need the values of p and q
as input.  Your program must allow these values can be given as command 
line arguments or allow the user to be prompted for these values while 
the program is being executed.  Thus your program must parse the command
line arguments are check if two integer values are given.  If they are
given, these are the values to be used for p and q.  If they are not
given, prompt the user to enter in these values.  This prompting is to be
done via a text-based interface.  Once the values of p and q are supplied,
your program must verify that they are different prime numbers.  If they
are not different prime numbers, 
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
Your program must also verify that the prime
numbers result in a value of n that is greater than 127.  If the
value of n is less than or equal to 127, 
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
<p>
The filenames that are used to contain the keys can be anything.  Your
program should use some default name if the user does not specify
a name (such as key1, key2 or pubkey, prikey).  The user is to be allowed
specify the names via the command line flag of <b>-o</b>.  Immediately
following
the flag two words should be given which will be used to hold the
public key and the private key.  If the user does not provide two 
words after the -o flag, 
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
<p>
The command line arguments can be given in any order as long as the
two words for the key filenames immediately follow the -o flag if
present.
<p>
<b>For 5 points extra credit</b>, your program can randomly generate two
valid prime numbers for p and q.  The user is to be able to inform your program
to do this by either specifying the command line argument flag of <b>-c</b>
or answering a prompt if the prime numbers are not given on the command line.
To receive the extra credit, your program must allow both methods.  The 
prime numbers generated must not always be the same pair of prime numbers
(i.e. you can't just hardcode two prime numbers into your program). 
<h3>Encryption Program</h3>
In order to keep things simple and verifiable, we will encrypt/decrypt one
ASCII character at a time.  The form of an encrypted file will be a
list of decimal integers one to a line.  Each line will correspond to
a single ASCII character in the original file.  
Since we want to use the same program for both encryption and decryption,
we will specify the command line flag of -e to encrypt and -d to decrypt.
While the algorithm is the same for both encryption and decryption, the
format of the input/output files alternate whether we are encrypting
or decrypting (hence the reason why we need these two flags).  If
neither the -e or the -d flag is given,
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
<p>
The user can specify the file to be encrypted or decrypted on the
command line with the flag of -f.  The word immediately following
the -f flag is the name of the file to be encrypted/decrypted.
If the -f flag is not given, the program is to prompt the user for
a filename.  If the file does not exist or no name is given,
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
When encrypting a file, the file is expected to be an ASCII text file.
When decrypting a file, the file is expected to contain one decimal
integer value per line.  If the file specified does not conform,
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
<p>
The user can specify the key file to be used on the command line
with the flag of -k.  The word immediately following the -k flag
is the name of the file that contains the key to be used.  If the
-k flag is not given, the program is to prompt the user for a
filename.  If the file does not exist or no name is given,
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
If the key file is not in the specified XML format,
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
<p>
The user can specify the name of the resulting encrypted/decrypted
file on the command line with the flag of -o.  The word immediately
following the -o flag is to be used as the filename to store the
resulting file.  If the -o flag is not give, the program is to prompt
the user for a filename.  If no name is given,
an error is to be reported to the
user and your program is to perform some "reasonable action".  
<p>
One issue that may arise with this program is the size of the integer
values as a result of the exponentiation required by the program.
You may note that this program may create encrypted files that are
not that difficult to decode.  This is the result of only encoding
one ASCII character at a time and allowing the use of small prime numbers 
for p and q.  
<p>
<h3>How to turn in your work</h3>
Your program is to be submitted electronically via the <b>turnin</b> 
command on the LINUX machines.  The project name for this is <b>mp1</b>. 
All programs are expected to be written in good programming style. 
<p>Turnin your program electronically using the &quot;turnin&quot; command <i>from 
your CS account </i>as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <code>turnin -c cs340 -p mp1&nbsp; [your project directory]</code>
</blockquote>
where the [your project directory] is the directory name under which you have 
all your files related to this programming problem. The turnin command will 
automatically compress the data under your directory, so there is no need to do 
the compression by yourself.
<p><font color="#008080">Notice you can only invoke turnin command on the Linux 
machines in the lab or after logging into the server machine oscar.cs.uic.edu.</font></p>
<p><br>
If you want to verify that your project was turned in, look in the turnin 
directory for a file with your userid. For instance for this project, from your 
CS account you would type:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; turnin -c cs340 -v</p>

<p>Note that you can execute turnin as many times as you would like, up until 
the program deadline when turnin will be disabled for this project. Each time 
you execute turnin for a project, you overwrite all of what you had turned in 
previously for that project.It <b>does not</b> work in an incremental way.</p>
