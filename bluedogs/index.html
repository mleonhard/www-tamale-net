<h1>Bluedogs Artificial Life Simulation</h1>

<p><a href="/">Home</a></p>

<p>Bluedogs is a graphical program that simulates artificial life
forms.  It is a rectangular world with green food that grows and
spreads.  The little creatures are like bacteria.  They wander around
eating food, splitting off children, and dying when their energy runs
out.</p>

<p>Each bacterium has a sequence of bytes that serve as instructions
for a virtual machine.  These instructions determine the behavior of
the bacterium.  I call the bytes the <em>genotype</em>.  When a
bacterium reproduces, its child gets a copy of its genotype with a few
random mutations.</p>

<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>
  The simulation maintains at least 50 live creatures.  If the
  population falls below 50, it creates new creatures with random
  genotypes and places them at random positions.  Initially, you will
  see creatures that are unable to turn.  They and their
  offspring eat rows through the food:

  </p>

<p>
  Suddenly, a creature is born that has the ability to turn!  Its
  offspring explode all over the world:

  </p>

<p>
  They fill the planet and begin consuming every resource:

  </p>

<p>
  When the food is consumed, they die off:

  </p>
<p>
  After several such boom-and-bust cycles, the creatures that survived
  are those that eat slowly and reproduce less often.  The simulation
  usually reaches a stable state, with populations fluctuating between
  200 and 1000 animals, and a moderate level of food:

  </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Run <code>bluedogs.exe</code> or <code>./bluedogs</code>.</p>

<p>Each update of the simulation is called a <em>day</em>.  Each
bacterium has a chance to eat, move, and reproduce every day.
Normally, the screen is drawn each day of the simulation, so you can
follow the bacteria in detail.  Clear the check-box to make the
program redraw the screen once a second.  This provides only snapshot
views of the activity but allows the simulation to run much
faster.</p>

<p>The circular graph is a view into the color chooser.  Every
bacterium is assigned a point in the circle.  That point is translated
into polar coordinates, (&theta;, r).  The polar coordinates are then
taken to be the Hue and Saturation values: H=&theta;,
S=r.  Thus, each bacterium's color is determined by its position in
the circle.  When a bacterium reproduces, its child is assigned a
position very nearby.  The result is that families of bacteria tend to
have the same shade of color.</p>

<p>A bacterium's energy level is shown by its brightness.  This is the
V component of the bacterium's color.  See <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSV_color_space">HSV Color
Space</a> on WikiPedia.</p>
